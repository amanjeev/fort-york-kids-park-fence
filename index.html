        <h1>June Callwood - Fort York Kids' Park - Fence Request</h1>
        <div class="grid">
            <p>
                Dear Councillor Malik,
            </p>
            <p>
                We are residents of Spadina-FortYork and want to bring your attention to the June Callwood kids' section park right next to the Bentway. We created this webpage with photos of the park to showcase that while every other kids' park in the vicinity has a fence around it, this one does not. We are not unsure why fence was not put up in the first place but it has been raised within the parents who meet outside that a fence is necessary for anywhere there are kids.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see in the pictures, there are roads on all four sides of this park.
                <ul>
                    <li>On the North side is Fort York Blvd</li>
                    <li>On the South side is Fleet Street</li>
                    <li>On the East side is Bastion Street</li>
                    <li>On the West side is Gzowski Blvd</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                This makes the situation of this park in uniquely risky place.
            </p>
            <p>
                We would like to initiate a discussion on how to add a fencing to this park. We see parents from aroud the Spadina-FortYork area all the time who come here and have the same concerns. Some of the concerns in this park are:
            </p>
            <p>
                - Concern about traffic and accidents. Kids need to plan and run around and some are small enough to not have yet learned the risk associated with roads and traffic safety.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Some dog owners around this area access the park sometimes and hygeiene has been an issue in the past.
